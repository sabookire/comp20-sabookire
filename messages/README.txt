index.html and lab.js display messages and usernames from data.json.

Currently messages and usernames are not displaying and there are two JS console errors. All other aspects are correctly implemented to the best of my knowledge.

3 hours spent completing assignment: mostly working with git and debugging JavaScript console errors.
