	<h1>Security Assessment of Check-In Locations</h1>
	<div class = "centered">Prepared by Sylvie Abookire ~ Friday, April 24, 2015</div>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p> The product "Check-In Locations" was designed to take in user's login, latitude, and longitude through a POST method, and display those messages on a Marauder's Map or alternate homepage. Users can also search for a the last check-in of a particular <code>login</code> via a GET method. I have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in the application. I hope my findings and suggestions are useful. Please <a href="mailto:sylvie.abookire@tufts.edu" target="_top">contact me</a> with questions or concerns.</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>My first means of testing were done through "black-box" testing. After that, I carefully examined the source code to find remaining security problems. Then, I documented my concerns below, with suggested resolutions. <p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>After careful examination of the product, I have found that it is vulnerable to several security and privacy flaws. Firstly, the app is not protected against cross-site scripting. Cross-site scripting is an attack where someone inputs malicious data into a user input field. In this product, the <code>login</code> field of the POST API accepts any type of data, including JavaScript code that can steal cookie information, redirect to malicious content, and/or insert annoying messages or other content. If attacked, all users would be presented with fraudulent web content. There are various ways to protect against this type of attack, discussed below.<br><br>

	Second, the product has a bug that causes the site to crash when a user tries to search for someone and there are no users' locations currently stored. Any bug that causes the site to crash is problematic, but this can be fixed by adding one simple line to the code (described below).<br><br>

	Last, this website is neither secure nor private. Everybody's information is available for everybody else to see and/or modify. Locations are neither private nor necessarily accurate. Improvements in this regard are also discussed below.</p>
	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<h3> 1. Cross-Site Scripting: </h3>
	<ul> 
		<li> Location: POST API (index.js) </li>
		<li> Severity: High. Check-In Locations trusts users to input the correct types of data. If, for example, a user inputs something other than a string in the <code>login</code> field, such as <a href = "curldata.html">this</a> JavaScript, the website could be seriously manipulated. It is susceptible to stolen cookie information, malicious code injection, and/or annoying messages. If attacked, all users would be presented with fraudulent web content.</li>
		<li> Description: Data inputted into the POST API is not escaped. This means that a user could input JavaScript or HTML, and the application would execute the script. </li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "alert.png" alt = "alert message"/>
		<li> Resolution: My client is already using the <a href = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator">npm validator package</a> to ensure <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> are variable type float. My suggestion to prevent cross-site scripting through the <code>login</code> parameter is to check that <code>validator.isAlphanumeric()</code> to check if <code>login</code> data contains only alpha or numeric characters. If other characters, such as the malicious <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> are inputted through <code>login</code>, the program will not run.</li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "isAlphanumeric.png" alt = "alpha numeric login"/>
		<p>Of course, this solution limits my client's user logins to alpha and numeric characters. If my client wishes to have user logins with other characters, I recommend parsing the data and replacing malicious characters with their HTML counter parts (e.g. replace <code>&lt;</code> with <code>&amplt;</code>) using the <code>validator.escape()</code> method.
	</ul>
	<h3>2. When database is empty, server crashes: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Location: GET API (index.js) </li>
		<li>Severity: High. If the database is empty, the server crashes. It is not unlikely that the database will be empty at some points for this product, and crashing the server when this happens is very detrimental to the product. </li>
		<li>Description: The following code has a bug that leads to the server crashing when the page is loaded and the database is empty:</li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "POST_code.png" alt = "POST code"/>
		<p>If the array length is 0, the program executes <code>response.send([])</code>. However, the program does not return after this statement. It therefore enters the following for loop, after which it executes <code>index += "</body></html>";</code> and <code>response.send(index);</code>, which first results in the [] response, but after the page is refreshed, the server crashes.</p>
		<div class = "centered"> Before refresh: </div>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "empty_array.png" alt = "Empty array"/>
		<div class = "centered"> After refresh: </div>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "connection_refused.png" alt = "Server crashes"/>
	<li>Resolution: Add a <code>return;</code> statement after <code>response.send([]);</code> to prevent the proceeding code from beng executed.</li>
	<IMG class = "displayed" src = "fixed-emptyarray-crash.png" alt = "Resolution"/>
	</ul>
	<h3> 3. Privacy and security are at risk: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Location: POST API (index.js)</li>
		<li> Severity: Moderate.  This is problematic for a few reasons. Anyone with the link to this website can submit anything they want to it. This could be their username and accurate location, or it could be a whole slew of other things, including their username and a false location, or someone else's username and a real or false location. Any of these options aside from the first would be very bad. </li>
		<li> Description: The open-ended POST API at <code>'/sendLocation'</code>, data allows anyone with any username to submit any location. If someone with evil intentions had someone else's <code>login</code>, they could change that person's location to something else. Or, if that person didn't want their location to be displayed publicly, someone who knew where they were could use their <code>login</code> to post their location to the site against their will. That raises the second point, which is that the app is public, which means that anyone in the world can view it and see the locations that are posted.</li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "Obama.png" alt = "Resolution"/>
		<p>This is also what allows anyone to send data to the website. In addition, if someone wanted to send a false location, they could pretend to be some place they're not. The site trusts the users to input accurate data, but doesn't do anything to ensure this accuracy.</p>
		<li> Resolution: One solution to the privacy concerns would be to make the POST API password protected. In order to submit a location for a username, the user would have to submit both a <code>login</code> and an associated password. That way, users could only modify their own locations. This would fix some of the problems. To ensure accurate data, the product could get locations using the user's device's GPS, through for example the <a href = 'https://developers.google.com/maps/web/'>Google Maps API</a>. This would help to prevent false locations from being easily sent through the POST API.</li>
	</ul>
