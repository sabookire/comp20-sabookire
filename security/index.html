	<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p> The product "Check-In Locations" was designed to take in user's login, latitude, and longitude through a POST method, and display those messages on a Marauder's Map via a GET method. I have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in the application.</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>My first means of testing were done through "black-box" testing. After that, I carefully examined the source code to find remaining security problems. Then, I documented all concerns below, with suggested resolutions. <p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<h3> 1. Cross-Site Scripting </h3>
	<ul> 
		<li> Location: POST API  (index.js) </li>
		<li> Severity: High. Check-In Locations trusts users to input the correct types of data. If, for example, a user inputs something other than a string in the 'login' field, such as JavaScript as in <a href = "curldata.html">this</a> example, the website could be seriously manipulated. </li>
		<li> Description: Data inputted into the POST API is not escaped. This means that a user could input JavaScript or HTML, and the application would execute the script. </li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "alert.png" alt = "alert message"/>
		<li> Resolution: To resolve this issue, </li>

<!--Introduction - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do
Methodology - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.
Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:
Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
Location / page where issue was found
Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are ideal.
Resolution. How did you resolve the issue? Show code if possible.-->
