	<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p> The product "Check-In Locations" was designed to take in user's login, latitude, and longitude through a POST method, and display those messages on a Marauder's Map via a GET method. I have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in the application.</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>My first means of testing were done through "black-box" testing. After that, I carefully examined the source code to find remaining security problems. Then, I documented all concerns below, with suggested resolutions. <p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<h3> 1. Cross-Site Scripting: </h3>
	<ul> 
		<li> Location: POST API (index.js) </li>
		<li> Severity: High. Check-In Locations trusts users to input the correct types of data. If, for example, a user inputs something other than a string in the 'login' field, such as <a href = "curldata.html">this</a> JavaScript, the website could be seriously manipulated. It is susceptible to stolen cookie information, malicious code injection, and/or annoying messages. If attacked, all users would be presented with fraudulent web content.</li>
		<li> Description: Data inputted into the POST API is not escaped. This means that a user could input JavaScript or HTML, and the application would execute the script. </li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "alert.png" alt = "alert message"/>
		<li> Resolution: My client is already using the <a href = "https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator">npm validator package</a> to ensure <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> are variable type float. My suggestion to prevent cross-site scripting through the login parameter is to check that <code>validator.isAlphanumeric()</code> to check if <code>login</code> data contains only alpha or numeric characters. If other characters, such as the malicious <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> are inputted through login, the program will not run.</li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "isAlphanumeric.png" alt = "alpha numeric login"/>
		<p>Of course, this solution limits my client's user logins to alpha and numeric characters. If my client wishes to have user logins with other characters, I recommend parsing the data and replacing malicious characters with their HTML counter parts (e.g. replace <code>&lt;</code> with <code>&amplt;</code>) using the <code>validator.escape()</code> method.
	</ul>
	<h3>2. When database is empty, server crashes: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Location: GET API (index.js) </li>
		<li>Severity: High. If the database is empty, the server crashes. It is not unlikely that the database will be empty at some points for this product, and crashing the server when this happens is very detrimental to the product. </li>
		<li>Description: The following code has a bug that leads to the server crashing when the page is loaded and the database is empty:</li>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "POST_code.png" alt = "POST code"/>
		<p>If the array length is 0, the program executes <code>response.send([])</code>. However, the program does not return after this statement. It therefore enters the following for loop, after which it executes <code>index += "</body></html>";</code> and <code>response.send(index);</code>, which first results in the [] response, but after the page is refreshed, the server crashes.</p>
		<div class = "centered"> Before refresh: </div>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "empty_array.png" alt = "Empty array"/>
		<div class = "centered"> After refresh: </div>
		<IMG class = "displayed" src = "connection_refused.png" alt = "Server crashes"/>
	<li>Resolution: Add a <code>return;</code> statement after <code>response.send([]);</code> to prevent the proceeding code from beng executed.</li>
	<IMG class = "displayed" src = "fixed-emptyarray-crash.png" alt = "Resolution"/>
	</ul>
	<h3> 3. Something </h3>

		<li> Severity: </li>
		<li> Description: </li>
		<li> Resolution: </li>

<!--Introduction - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do
Methodology - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.
Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:
Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
Location / page where issue was found
Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are ideal.
Resolution. How did you resolve the issue? Show code if possible.-->
