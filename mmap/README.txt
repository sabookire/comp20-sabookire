index.html find's my location and sends it to a datastore, data.json, which returns the locations of my classmates that have also sent their locations to the datastore. Then, index.html displays my locaction with a marker that has my picture as the icon and says "Here I am!" in an info window that opens when someone clicks on the marker. It displays my classmates locations with default google markers and info windows that tell how far away each classmate is from me in miles.

All aspects correctly implemented to the best of my knowledge.

I received help getting started and debugging from Ming Chow.

I spent approximately 8 hours on this assignment.
