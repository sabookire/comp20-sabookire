COMP 20 Spring 2015 Private Repo for Sylvie Abookire

What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
  This git repository holds all of the files for all of my individual comp20 assignments and labs. It private so that the whole
  world cannot have access to my files.
What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
  My favorite assignment was Marauder's Map. It was cool to learn how to use an API and I enjoyed learning JavaScript. I started 
  to see how the ideas we're learning and using in class could be extrapolated to some cool ideas for web or mobile apps and 
  that is really exciting.
How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
  A ton.
What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
  The most important thing I've learned is what types of resources are available for web programming and how to figure out where
  information is (e.g. API documentations, stackoverflow, etc), and how to find the information I need. I started this in 
  assignment 1, using w3schools to look up html tags or css selectors. Another example is for the final project, I worked on
  implementing Facebook login for my group's website. To do this I just googled Facebook API and easily found out how to use
  their API and how to implement Facebook login. Before this course, I wouldn't have known to do this.
Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
  I would like to start doing side projects on topics that interest me, like nutrition and health. I plan on working on a website
  for a consulting company (quality improvement in healthcare) that my mom is in the process of starting. I also am curious
  to learn Swift and do some iOS programming this summer. After having taken this course I feel more confident in my ability
  to learn things on my own, and I have already found some Swift tutorials online. As for specific topics, I found security
  very interesting, and I would like to delve deeper into that.
